<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a 100% pure Java implementation of
Berkeley DB. It implements a transactional store model based on a
B+Tree access method.
</p>
<p>The documentation set for JE includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>JE's capabilities and features are described in the <a
 href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/je/GettingStartedGuide/index.html">Getting
Started with Berkeley DB Java Edition</a> guide. That document also
introduces the JE API set.</li>

<li>For a description of how to use JE and the new Direct Persistence Layer, see the <a
 href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/je/PersistenceAPI/index.html">Getting
Started with the Direct Persistence Layer</a> guide.</li>

<li>For a description of how to use JE and the Berkeley DB Java Collections
API, see the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/je/collections/tutorial/index.html">collections
tutorial</a>.</li>

<li>For an overview on using transactions, see <a 
 href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/je/TransactionGettingStarted/index.html">Writing
 Transactional Applications with Berkeley DB, Java Edition</a></li>

<li>For a complete description of the JE API set, see the <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/je/java/index.html">Javadoc</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is release 3.2.13 of Berkeley DB Java Edition, and
the first release in the JE 3.2 line. The changes introduced in 3.2.13
mainly encompass bug fixes and efficiency improvements, but also
include a forward-compatible file format change.
<p>
Key changes since version JE 3.1.0
are summarized below; the complete list of changes can also be found in <a
href="changelog.html">the change log page</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Note: If you are using Mac OS X, please be aware of the following
issue. Java version 1.4.2 on Mac OS X reports the wrong value for
Runtime.maxMemory. JE calculates the default cache size as a percentage
of maxMemory.&nbsp; Because of this, for Java 1.4.2 on Mac OS X only,
JE will assume that the Java maxMemory value is 64 MB.&nbsp; With the
default je.maxMemoryPercent configuration parameter (60%) the default
JE cache size will be approximately 38 MB.&nbsp; This default is fixed
-- it does not change if the Java memory size is different than 64
MB.&nbsp; To specify a different JE cache size, you must explicitly set
the je.maxMemory configuration property.&nbsp; The je.maxMemory
property can be specified in the je.properties file or by calling
EnvironmentConfig.setCacheSize.
</p>
<h3>Log File On-Disk Format Changes:</h3>
<p>
JE 3.2.13 has moved to on-disk file format 5.
<p>
The change is forward compatible in that JE files created with release
3.1.0 and earlier can be read when opened with JE 3.2.13. The change
is not backward compatible in that files created with JE 3.2.13
cannot be read by earlier releases. Note that if an existing environment is
opened read/write, a new log file is written by JE 3.2.13 and the
environment can no longer be read by earlier releases.[#15195]
<br>

<h3>Other Changes:</h3>
JE 3.2.13 includes
<ul>
<li>New configuration properties to control background I/O.</li>
<li>Tuple binding support and DPL support for BigInteger.</li>
<li>A variety of bug fixes and documentation enhancements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for the complete and
detailed description of all changes.
