# Lines beginning with a # character are comments; they are ignored.
# Many example lines are provided here commented out

# the blockfile contains patterns to be blocked by the proxy
#blockfile		sblock.ini	# comments are OK here, too
#
# or can use full paths for files, like so
#
#blockfile		/usr/local/lib/junkbusters/blockfile

# the cookiefile contains patterns to specify the cookie management policy
#
#cookiefile		scookie.ini

# the logfile is where all logging and error messages are written
#
#logfile		logfile

# the jarfile is where cookies can be stored
#
#jarfile		jarfile	

# the forwardfile defines domain-specific routing
#
#forwardfile		sforward.ini

# file which lists and into which trusted domains are written
#
#trustfile		strust.ini
# files specify locations of "for information about trusted referers, see.."
# multiple trust_info_url lines are OK
#
# trust_info_url		http://internet.junkbuster.com/

# add an "X-Forwarded-For:" specification to each request header
#
#add-forwarded-header

# if logging cookies into a jarfile, and no other wafers were
# explicity set, then by default a vanilla wafer is sent with
# each request.
#
# setting 'suppress-vanilla-wafer' stops this vanilla wafer from
# being sent.
#
#suppress-vanilla-wafer

# add these wafers to each request header
# multiple wafer lines are OK
#
#wafer		NOTE=Like most people, I want my browsing to be anonymous.
#wafer		WARNING=Please do not attempt to track me.

# Anything can be added to the request headers. Please don't litter.
# multiple add-header lines are OK
#

#add-header		Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive

# listen-address specifies where the Junkbuster will listen for connections
# (it's equivalent to the -h option in Version 1)
# Specifying a port is optional; if unspecified the defaults is 8000.
# Before Version 2.0.2 the default was to bind to all IP addresses (INADDR_ANY)
# This has been restricted to localhost to avoid unintended security breaches.
# To open the proxy to all, uncomment the following line:

listen-address		:8888

# other example usage:
#listen-address		124.207.250.245:8080
# to explicitly state what is now the default:
#listen-address		localhost

# user-agent specifies treatment of the "User-Agent:" (and "UA-*:") header(s)
#user-agent		@
# note: Russian browsers may be confused if user agent misidentifies
# the operating system (Mac vs Windows); see FAQ
#user-agent		.

# referer specifies treatment of the "Referer:" header
#
#referer		@

# from specifies value to be subsituted if browser provides a "From:" header

# hide-console is used only on Win32. It instructs the Internet Junkbuster
# to disconnect from and hide the command console.

#hide-console

# debug sets the level of debugging information to log in the logfile
#
# debug			 1	# GPC  = show each GET/POST/CONNECT request
# debug			 2	# CONN = show each connection status
# debug			 4	# IO   = show I/O status
# debug			 8	# HDR  = show header parsing
# debug			16	# LOG  = log all data into the logfile
#
# multiple "debug" directives, are OK - they're logical-OR'd together
#
# debug			15	# same as setting the first 4 listed above

# single-threaded operation (i.e. disallows multiple threads or processes)
# This is most often used for debugging because it keeps the
# debugging output "in order" for easy reading.
