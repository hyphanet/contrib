<h3><a name="what" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=what"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
What is the Internet Junkbuster Proxy and what does it do for me?
</h3>
<p>
The
Internet Junkbuster
Proxy
<a href="legal.html#marks"><small><sup>TM</sup></small></a>
is
<a href="ijbfaq.html#free">free</a>
privacy-enhancing software that can be run on your PC or by your
<small>ISP</small>
or company.
It blocks requests for
<small>URL</small>s
(typically banner ads)
that match its
<a href="ijbfaq.html#blocking">blockfile.</a>
It also deletes unauthorized
<a href="ijbfaq.html#cookies">cookies</a>
and other
unwanted identifying
<a href="ijbfaq.html#anonymity">header information</a>
that is exchanged between web servers and browsers.
These headers are not normally accessible to users
(even though they may contain information that's important to your privacy),
but with the
Internet Junkbuster
you can see almost
<a href="ijbman.html#o_d">anything you want</a>
and control everything you're likely to need.
<b>You</b>
<a href="over.html#you_def">decide what's junk.</a>
<a href="legal.html#marks"><small><sup>SM</sup></small></a>
Many people
<a href="ijbfaq.html#readymade">publish</a>
their blockfiles to help others get started.
</p>

<h3><a name="free" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=free"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Is there a license fee / warranty / registration form / expiration?
</h3>
<p>
No, none of these.
It's completely free of charge.
Junkbusters
offers you the software to copy, use, modify and distribute
as you wish, forever, at
<a href="over.html#nobucks">no charge</a>
under the
<a href="gpl.html">GNU General Public License.</a>
<p>
<a name="warranty">It comes with</a>
<a href="gpl.html#nowarr">no warranty of any kind.</a>
<p>
<a name="register">You don't have to register,</a>
in fact we don't even provide a way to do so:
the practice of registering software is
usually just an
excuse
to send you solicitations and
<a href="self.html#warranty">sell your name</a>
and information about your behavior.
You are welcome to obtain and use our software as anonymously you wish.
(Your
<small>IP</small>
address will naturally be
<a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/cgi-bin/privacy">disclosed</a>
when you download it,
so if you work for a web ad company
you might want to use a service such as the
<a href="ijbfaq.html#anonymizing">lpwa.com</a>
when you get it.
We
<a href="over.html#nopriv">never</a>
want to be given any information that you consider private or confidential.)
<p>
<a name="why">We are often asked why we give away a product that many</a>
would happily pay for.
The answer is that we are determined to carry out our
<a href="over.html">mission:</a>
to free the world from junk communications.

<h3><a name="windows" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=windows"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Does it run on Windows? On a Mac? On the AOL browser?
</h3>
<p>
For the latest information on availability, see the
<a href="ijbdist.html">Distribution Information</a>
page.
We
<a href="ijbdist.html#win3.1">don't</a>
think it will ever run on
Windows 3.1.
But you don't need to have it running on your computer
if you get your
<small>ISP</small>
or Systems Administrator at
<a href="ijbfaq.html#companies">work</a>
to run it.
</p>

<h3><a name="isp" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=isp"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How can I get my ISP to run the Internet Junkbuster?
</h3>
<p>
Try their sales or support department
(depending on whether you are already a customer).
<a name="unaware">You might send them email including the following</a>
<small>URL</small>:
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijbfaq.html#isps</kbd></big>
<br>
<a name="switch">You could mention that many</a>
<a href="ijbfaq.html#does">other</a>
<small>ISP</small>s
provide it,
and that you regard it as an important part of your decision on
where to buy Internet service.
</p>

<h3><a name="who" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=who"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Who chooses the options that control what is blocked?
</h3>
<p>
Whoever starts the
Internet Junkbuster
chooses the options and the blockfile.
If your 
<small>ISP</small>
runs it for you, they have to make these decision
(though
<a href="http://www.lunatech.com/proxy/">some</a>
may give you a choice of proxies,
and a way to suggest new
<small>URL</small>s
to block).
If you run it on your computer,
<b>You</b>
<a href="over.html#you_def">decide what's junk.</a>
<a href="legal.html#marks"><small><sup>SM</sup></small></a>
</p>

<h3><a name="self" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=self"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How do I download and run the program on my computer?
</h3>
<p>
It depends on your platform.
If you are using Windows 95 or NT,
see our separate page on
<a href="ijbwin.html">installing under Windows.</a>
If you have a C compiler and are using almost any flavor of
<small>UNIX <a href="legal.html#not_our_trademark">&#174;</a></small>
you
<a href="ijbfaq.html#local">download it, compile it, start it running,</a>
and then
<a href="ijbfaq.html#browser">configure your browser.</a>
Several precompiled packages are also available through links in our
<a href="ijbdist.html">distribution page</a>,
which lists all available platforms.
<p>
<a name="port">If you are using a platform for which we have no current</a>
availability,
you are welcome to port the code.
If you do this and you would like us to consider publishing your ported version,
please
<a href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=port">tell us.</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="show" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=show"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How can I tell which blockfile and options are being used?
</h3>
<p>
Just point your browser to
<a href="http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-proxy-args">http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-proxy-args</a>
or to any
<small>URL</small>
ending in
<big><kbd>show-proxy-args</kbd></big>
(even if it doesn't exist).
It needn't exist because the
Internet Junkbuster 2.0
intercepts the request, blocks it,
and returns in its place
information about itself.
Using the
<small>URL</small>
above is useful for checking that your browser really is
going through an
Internet Junkbuster,
because the
<big><kbd>junkbuster.com</kbd></big>
server returns a warning if the request actually gets to it.
Some people set the home page of their browser to such a
<small>URL</small>
to be sure that it is configured to use the proxy.
<p>
<a name="headers">If you wish to check the header information</a>
your proxy is actually sending,
a visit to
<a href="http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-http-headers">http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-http-headers</a>
will give you the more relevant ones first.
You might also like to turn the proxy
<a href="ijbfaq.html#discontinue">off</a>
and compare the difference. (Don't forget to turn it back on again.)
</p>

<h3><a name="responding" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=responding"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
My browser started giving me ``server not responding'' messages
</h3>
<p>
Once your browser is told to use a proxy such as the
Internet Junkbuster,
it thinks of it as its server for everything,
so this message means it can't talk to the proxy.
The
Internet Junkbuster
may not be running,
or you may have specified its proxy
<a href="ijbfaq.html#address">address</a>
incorrectly.
Check that the details you entered are correct.
If you have
<big><kbd>telnet</kbd></big>
you can try connecting to the appropriate port to see if the
Internet Junkbuster
is running.
If your
<small>ISP</small>
is running the
Internet Junkbuster,
you may want to check with them.
If you are running it yourself under
<small>UNIX <a href="legal.html#not_our_trademark">&#174;</a></small>,
try looking at a
<big><kbd>ps ax</kbd></big>
to see if it is running.
The
<a href="ijbman.html#o_h">port</a>
specified in its options should be the same one as your
browser has configured.

What is the proxy address of the Internet Junkbuster?
</h3>
<p>
<a name="localhost">If you set up</a>
the
Internet Junkbuster
to run on the computer you browse from
(rather than your
<small>ISP</small>'s server
or some networked computer at work),
the proxy will be on
<big><kbd>localhost</kbd></big>
(which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to
refer to itself)
and
the port will be
<big><kbd>8000</kbd></big>
(unless you have told the
Internet Junkbuster
to
run on a different port with the
<a href="ijbman.html#listen-address">listen-address</a>
option).
So you when
<a href="ijbfaq.html#set">configuring your browser's proxy settings</a>
you typically enter the word
<big><kbd>localhost</kbd></big>
in the two boxes next to
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">
HTTP</font></b>
and
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">
Secure</font></b>,
and the number
<big><kbd>8000</kbd></big>
in the two boxes labelled
to the right of those boxes.
<p>
<a name="remote">If your</a>
<small>ISP</small>
or company is running 
the
Internet Junkbuster
for you,
they will tell you the address to use.
It will be the name of the computer it's running on
(or possibly its numeric IP address),
plus a port number.
Port 8000 is the default, so assume this number if it is not specified.
Sometimes a colon is used to glue them together,
as in
<big><kbd>junkbuster.fictitous-pro-privacy-isp.net:8000</kbd></big>
but
with most browsers
you do not type the colon,
you enter the address and port number in separate boxes.

<h3><a name="set" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=set"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How do I tell the browser where to find the Internet Junkbuster?
</h3>
<p>
All current browsers can be told the address of a proxy to use.
You enter the same information in two fields in your browser's proxy
configuration screen (see list below): one for
<small>HTTP</small>,
and one for the Secure Protocol (assuming your browser supports
<small>SSL</small>).
If you find some information already entered for your proxy,
see the
<a href="ijbfaq.html#already">next question.</a>
Here are the menus you go through to get to the proxy configuration settings.
(We also recommend that you
<a href="links.html#java">disable Java</a>,
which is a separate operation.)
<strong>Make notes on the changes you make so you know how to undo them!</strong>
You will need to know what you did
in case you wish to

you can specify the proxy via environment variables
before starting the application.
This will probably be done with something like either
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>setenv http_proxy http://localhost:8000/</kbd></big>
<br>
or
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>http_proxy=http://junkbuster.fictitous-pro-privacy-isp.net:8000/ export http_proxy</kbd></big>

What should I do if I find another proxy is already configured?
</h3>
<p>
Some
<small>ISP</small>s
and companies require all Web traffic to go through their proxy.
In this case you would find your proxy configuration with values already set,
possibly under
<a name="Automatic">Automatic Proxy Configuration</a>
(in the case of 
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html">Netscape</a>
and
<a href="http://ieak.microsoft.com/">MS-IE 3.0</a>
and above).
It's probably a firewall proxy between your company and the outside world,
<a name="cache">or a</a>
<a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/CacheNow/">caching proxy</a>
if you're using an 
<small>ISP</small>.
<p>
<a name="f">What needs to be done in this case is to</a>
use the
<a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwardfile</a>
option
to tell the
Internet Junkbuster
the address of the other proxy.
Specify a different (unused) port number
with the
<a href="ijbman.html#listen-address">listen-address</a>
option,
and configure your browser to
<a href="ijbfaq.html#chain">use that port.</a>
If you haven't done this kind of thing before,
it's probably best to consult your systems administrator or 
<small>ISP</small>
about it;
check their web page first.

Automatic dialing isn't working any more. How do I fix it?
</h3>
<p>
Some browsers (such as MSIE-4) can be configured to dial your
<small>ISP</small>
automatically when you click on a link,
but this feature gets disabled if you specify a proxy running on your
own computer
(with address
<big><kbd>localhost</kbd></big>
or
<big><kbd>127.0.0.1</kbd></big>)
because these addresses don't require dialing.
The
Internet Junkbuster
knows nothing about dialing, so it doesn't work.
To make automatic dialing work,
make up a name such as
<big><kbd>junkbuster.ijb</kbd></big>
and use that name in the proxy settings
instead of
<big><kbd>localhost</kbd></big>,
and then add the line
<big><kbd>127.0.0.1 junkbuster.ijb</kbd></big>
to the file
<big><kbd>c:\windows\hosts</kbd></big>
(if there already is a line beginning with
<big><kbd>127.0.0.1</kbd></big>
just add
<big><kbd>junkbuster.ijb</kbd></big>
at the end of it.)

it.
If you get a message along the lines of ``server not responding,
using cached copy instead,'' see the advice
<a href="ijbfaq.html#responding">above.</a>
If the page reloads OK, check that your browser is actually
talking to the proxy by going to
<a href="http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-proxy-args">http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-proxy-args</a>
or any
<small>URL</small>
ending in

<h3><a name="chain" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=chain"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How and why would I have this proxy chained with other proxies?
</h3>
<p>
You may need the 
<a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwarding</a>
feature to ``daisy chain'' the
Internet Junkbuster
to another proxy, perhaps an
<a href="ijbfaq.html#anonymizing">anonymizing</a>
proxy to
<a href="ijbfaq.html#conceal">conceal</a>
your
<small>IP</small>
address,
or a
<a href="ijbfaq.html#cache">caching proxy</a>
from your
<small>ISP</small>,
or a
<a href="ijbfaq.html#firewall">firewall</a>
proxy between your company and the outside world.
Version 2.0
can be even configured to forward
<a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">selectively</a>
according to the
<small>URL</small>
requested:
for example, connecting directly to trusted hosts,
but going through an anonymizing or firewall proxy for all other hosts.
<p>
<a name="administrator">Network administrators might use it to provide</a>
transparent access to multiple networks without
modifying browser configurations.
<a name="direct">Most browsers also provide a way of</a>
specifying hosts that the browser
connects to directly, bypassing the proxy. Some provide a method for
<a href="ijbfaq.html#Automatic">Automatic Proxy Configuration.</a>
A well written
Internet Junkbuster
configuration can be much more flexible and powerful.
<p>
<a name="example">An</a>
<small>ISP</small>'s
caching proxy
would typically be called something like
<big><kbd>cache.your-isp.net:8080</kbd></big>
(as described on you
<small>ISP</small>'s
web page);
you would put this information in your
<a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwardfile</a>
as described in our manual.
Your browser would be configured to
the
Internet Junkbuster
for
<small>HTTP</small>
and Security Proxies as before,
but you probably want to tell it to use the caching proxy
for
<small>FTP</small>
and other protocols.
<a name="nonlocal">If your</a>
<small>ISP</small>
is running
the
Internet Junkbuster
for you,
they have probably already decided whether to chain with a caching proxy.

<h3><a name="socks" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=socks"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How does the Internet Junkbuster work with SOCKS gateways?
</h3>
<p>
There is support for some
<a href="http://www.leverage.com/users/tlod/ssockd/ssockd.html">gateways</a>
in
Version <a href="ijbdist.html#c4">1.4</a>
and above.
The gateway protocol used to be specified on the command line;
it is
now specified
in the same file as
<a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwarding.</a>
Note that the browser's proxy configuration must
<em>not</em>
specify a
<big><kbd>SOCKS</kbd></big>
host;
it should specify the proxy as described
<a href="ijbfaq.html#set">above.</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="plain" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=plain"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How do I configure it to be just a plain old proxy?
</h3>
<p>
To get the proxy to do as little as possible (which means not deleting any
sensitive headers), place in your
configuration file the following three lines (each ending in a space
then a period) to stop it changing sensitive headers:
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>referer .</kbd></big>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>from .</kbd></big>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>user-agent .</kbd></big>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>cookiefile mycookiefile</kbd></big>
<br>
The fourth line is also needed to specify a
<a href="ijbman.html#o_c">cookiefile</a>
that might be called
<big><kbd>mycookiefile</kbd></big>
containing a single line with a
<big><kbd>*</kbd></big>
character, to allow all cookies through.

</h3>
<p>
It depends on your platform. Under Windows, use

in the 
<small>DOS</small>
window or
the old three-fingered salute of
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">

First, the president of the Internet Advertising Bureau told
<a href="new.html#Rich">CNET</a>

Second, after the Federal Trade Commission's
<a href="ftc.html">workshop</a>
where we gave a live demonstration of our proxy before
many eminent representatives of the industry,
the

<blockquote>
Clever shareware developers have come up with products that

If running several proxies, you could either use different ports

you could
use different hostname aliases such as
<big><kbd>banner.junkbuster.our-isp.net</kbd></big>,

What's a Proxy Server Server and how can I make money as one?
</h3>
<p>
Other organizations with web presence and some bandwidth to spare
can set up as
<i><dfn>Proxy Server Servers</dfn></i>
<!-- Aside: All this, and... -->
(<small>PS<sup>2</sup></small>s).
The idea here is to allow users to choose their proxy configuration,
and provide it to them on a semi-permanent basis.
Users would fill in a form specifying what options they want in
their proxy,
possibly even at a very high level, such as
``no ads''
or ``no nudity.''
This information is sent to a
<small>CGI</small>
script that
configures a proxy, starts it running, and returns its address and port number
(possibly along with configuration instructions for the browser
that the user specified.)
<p>
<a name="revenue">Users</a>
could be charged
a subscription fee,
or the service could be thrown in free in the hope of
improving customer retention for some existing business
(which is what
<small>ISP</small>s
are doing).
It might be possible to make money by
inserting new ads in the holes left where others were blocked,
but the original owners might object.
<small>PS<sup>2</sup></small>s
could differentiate themselves
by providing frequently updated and comprehensive
blocking of ads, or of offensive material based on their own grading system.
Some content providers might do it for the chance to be the
only company that the consumer permits to set cookies.
(Identification could even be done via cookies,
but this might not be popular with the kind of user who wants a proxy.)
<small>PS<sup>2</sup></small>s
might sell specific or aggregate information about their
users' browsing habits,
so the agreement with users on whether they are permitted to do this
would be important to both sides.

<p>
The sample blockfile we provide blocks almost nothing,

But others have; you can find them by

If I see an ad I wish I hadn't, how do I stop it?
</h3>
<p>
If your
<small>ISP</small>
is running the
Internet Junkbuster,
they should have a policy on whether they accept suggestions from
their customers on what to block. Consult their web page.
<p>
<a name="cover">If you are running</a>
the
Internet Junkbuster
yourself, you have complete control over what gets through.
Just add a pattern to cover the offending 
<small>URL</small>
to your blockfile.
Version 1.3 and later automatically rereads the blockfile when it changes,
but if you're running an earlier version you'll
have to
<a href="ijbfaq.html#shutdown">stop it</a>
and restart it.
<p>
<a name="target">To choose a pattern you'll first need to find the</a>
<small>URL</small>
of the ad you want cover.
<p>
<a name="pinpoint">Some people use the</a>
<a href="ijbman.html#debug">debug</a>
<big><kbd>1</kbd></big>
option to display each 
<small>URL</small>
in a window as the request is sent to the server.
It's then usually an easy task to pick the offending 
<small>URL</small>
from the list of recent candidates.
<p>
<a name="source">Alternatively,</a>
you can use
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">
View Document Info</font></b>
(or
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">
View Document Source</font></b>
if your browser doesn't have that).
The
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">
Info</font></b>
feature has the advantage of showing you the full
<small>URL</small>
including the host name,
which may not be specified in the source:
there you might see something like
<big><kbd>SRC="/ads/click_here_or_die.gif"</kbd></big>
indicating only the
<i><dfn>path</dfn></i>.
(The host name is assumed to be the same as the one the page came from.)
<p>
<a name="offsite">But ads often</a>
come from a different site, in which case you
might see something like
<big><kbd>SRC="grabem.n.trackem.com/Ad/Infinitum/SpaceID=1666"</kbd></big>
or longer.
<a name="warehouse">If the company looks like a pure ad warehouse</a>
(as in the last case),
you may want to place just its domain name in the blockfile,
which blocks all 
<small>URL</small>s
from that site.
<p>
<a name="wanted">If the ad comes from a server</a>
that you really want some content from,
you can include enough of the path
to avoid zapping stuff you might want.
In the first example above,
<big><kbd>/ads/</kbd></big>
would seem to be enough.
If you don't include the domain name,
the pattern applies to all sites,
so you don't want such patterns
to be too general:
for example
<big><kbd>/ad</kbd></big>
would block
<big><kbd>/admin/salaries/</kbd></big>
on your company's internal site.
<p>
<a name="image">To speed the blocking of images, some</a>
<small>UNIX <a href="legal.html#not_our_trademark">&#174;</a></small>
users create a
shell script called
<big><kbd>Image:</kbd></big>
containing a line such as
<big><kbd>echo $1 | sed s/http:..// &gt;&gt; $HOME/lib/blockfile</kbd></big>
that adds its argument to the user's blockfile.
Once an offending image has been be found using
<b><font face="arial, helvetica">
View Document Info</font></b>
it's easy to cut-and-paste the line (or part of it) into a shell window.
The same script can be linked to a file called
<big><kbd>Frame:</kbd></big>

<p>
<a name="partial">When compiled without the</a>

The pattern

will not stop
<big><kbd>/images/banners/huge.gif</kbd></big>
getting through: you would have to include the pattern
<big><kbd>/images/banners</kbd></big>
or something that matches in full from the left.
<a name="regex">So you can get what you want here,</a>
the matcher understands
<small>POSIX</small>

you can use

<big><kbd>/banners</kbd></big>
(even in the middle of the path).
<a name="posix">(In Versions 1.1 through 1.4</a>
they were an option at compile time;
from Version 2.0 they have become the default.)
Regular expressions give you
<a href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/localfiles/infofiles/gcc/rx_toc.html">many more features</a>
than this,
but if you're not already familiar with them you probably won't

<p>
If the ad had been displayed before you included its

How do I stop it blocking a URL that I actually want?
</h3>
<p>
You can change the patterns so they don't cover it,
or use a simple feature in Version 1.1 and later: a line beginning with a
<big><kbd>~</kbd></big>
character means that a
<small>URL</small>
blocked by previous patterns that matches the rest of
the line is let through.
For example,
the pattern
<big><kbd>/ad</kbd></big>
would block
<big><kbd>/addasite.html</kbd></big>
but not if followed by
<big><kbd>~/addasite</kbd></big>
in the blockfile.
Or suppose you want to see everything that comes from
a site you like, even if it looks like an ad: simply put
<big><kbd>~aSiteYouLike.com</kbd></big>
at the

of the blockfile.
(Order is important, because the last matching line wins.)
<p>
<a name="agreed">As well as unblocking</a>

this feature is useful for unblocking ads from a specific source.

Can I block sites I don't want my children to see?
</h3>
<p>
Yes, but remember that
<a name="savvy">children who are technically sophisticated enough</a>
to use the browsers' proxy configuration options
could of course bypass any proxy.
This kind of technology can be used as a gentle barrier to remind
or guide the child,
but nobody should expect it to replace the parent's role
in setting and enforcing standards of online behavior for their children.
<p>
<a name="recommend">Some</a>
<small>ISP</small>s
are starting to provide specialized proxies to protect children.
There are two basic approaches: the ``black list'' and the ``white list''
approach.
<a name="negative">The black list approach allows the child</a>
to go anywhere not explicitly prohibited; the white list permits visits
only to sites explicitly designated as acceptable.
<p>
<a name="positive">It's very easy for</a>
anyone to
compile a white list from a page of ``recommended
kids sites'' and to configure an
Internet Junkbuster
to allow access to those sites only.
If you compile with the
<a href="ijbfaq.html#regex">regex</a>
option,
you can place a
<big><kbd>*</kbd></big>
(asterisk) as the first line of the blockfile (which blocks everything),
and then list
<a href="ijbfaq.html#exceptions">exceptions</a>
after that.
Be careful to make the exception sufficiently broad:
for example, using
<big><kbd>~www.uexpress.com/ups/comics/ch/</kbd></big>
as the exception for
<a href="http://www.uexpress.com/ups/comics/ch/"><cite>Calvin and Hobbes</cite></a>
would block some of the graphic elements on the page;
you would probably want a wider exception such as
<big><kbd>~www.uexpress.com/ups/</kbd></big>
to permit them.
<p>
<a name="trust">Version 2.0 has an experimental feature</a>
to permit only sites mentioned in a nominated
<a href="ijbman.html#trustfile">trusted site.</a>
This allows organizations to build lists of sites for kids to browse,
and the software automatically restricts access to those on the list.
<p>
<a name="scan">Many filtering</a>
<a href="links.html#blocking">products</a>
actually scan for keywords in
the text of pages they retrieve
before presenting it,

the

in advance
exactly
what is obscene or unsuitable.

<h3><a name="message" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=message"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
What do I see when a page or graphic is blocked by the proxy?
</h3>
<p>
You usually see a broken image icon,
but it depends on several factors beyond the proxy's control.
If asked for a
<small>URL</small>
matching its blockfile, the proxy returns an
<small>HTML</small>
page containing a message identifying itself
(currently the two words ``Internet Junkbuster'')
with a status 202 (Accepted) instead of the usual 200 (OK).
(Versions 1.X returned an error 404: Forbidden, which caused
strange behavior in some cases.)
Status 202 is described in the
<small>HTTP</small>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc1945.html#Code202">RFC</a>
as indicating that the request has been accepted but not completed,
and that it might complete successfully in the future
(in our case, if the blockfile were changed).
<p>
<a name="depends">The broken image icon is most common</a>
because the browser is usually expecting a graphic.
But if it was expecting text, or if the page happens to be using certain
<small>HTML</small>
extensions
such as
<big><kbd>layer</kbd></big>
and your browser is a late model from Microsoft,
you may see the words ``Internet Junkbuster'' displayed as a hot link.
<p>
<a name="click">Clicking on the link takes you to an explanation of</a>
the pattern in the blockfile that caused the block,
so that you can edit the blockfile and go back and reload if you really
want to see what was blocked. The explanatory link is generated by
the proxy and is automatically intercepted based on its ending in
<big><kbd>ij-blocked-url</kbd></big>;
even though the site is specified as
<big><kbd>http://internet.junkbuster.com</kbd></big>
no request should actually made to that site.
If one is, it means that the proxy was been removed after it
generated the link.
<p>
<a name="layer">To summarize:</a>
the identifying link to the blocking explanation
is usually turned into a broken image icon,
but it may be displayed on a page alone,
or they may may be restricted to the particular frame, layer or graphic area
specified in the page containing them.
The proxy has no way of knowing the context in which a
<small>URL</small>
will be used and cannot control how the blocking message will be rendered.

<h3><a name="broken" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=broken"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Why not replace blocked banners with something invisible?
</h3>
<p>
<a name="infringe">Many users have suggested to us</a>
that blocked banners should be replaced by a something like a
1x1 transparent
<small>GIF</small>
to make the page would look as if there was nothing ever there.
Apart from making it harder to catch unintended blocking,
this might also displease the owners of the page,
who could argue that such a change constitutes a copyright infringement.
We think that merely failing to allow an included graphic to be accessed
would probably not be considered an infringement:
after all this is what happens when a browser
is configured not to load images automatically.
However, we are
<a href="over.html#notlaw">not</a>
lawyers,
so anyone in doubt should take appropriate advice.
<p>
<a name="done">In a context where the copyright issue is resolved</a>
satisfactorily,
a proxy could simply return a status 301 or 302 and
specify a replacement
<small>URL</small>

and/or
<big><kbd>URI</kbd></big>
header.
An alternative would be to use inline code to return a

Why not block banners based on the dimensions of the image?
</h3>
<p>
Many users have pointed out that most banner ads come in standard sizes,
so why not block all
<small>GIF</small>s
of those sizes?
This would theoretically be without fetching the object 
because the dimensions are usually given in the
<big><kbd>IMG</kbd></big>
tag,
but it would require substantial changes in the code,
and we doubt whether it would be much more effective than a good block list.

</h3>
<p>
The
Internet Junkbuster
deliberately
does not provide a way of automatically editing the contents of a page,
to remove textual advertising or
to repair the holes left by blocked banners.
Other packages such as
<a href="links.html#webfilter">WebFilter</a>
do.
<p>
<a name="base">For the same reason,</a>

Exactly how do cookies get created and stored anyway?
</h3>
<p>
When a web site's server sends you a page it also sends
certain ``header information'' which your browser records but does not display.
One of these is a
<big><kbd>Set-Cookie</kbd></big>
header, which specifies the cookie information that the server wants your browser to record.
Similarly, when your browser requests a page it also sends headers, specifying
information such as the graphics formats it understands.
If a cookie has previously been set by a site that matches the
<small>URL</small>
it is about to request,
your browser adds a
<big><kbd>Cookie</kbd></big>
header quoting the previous information.
<p>
<a name="privacy">For more background information on how cookies</a>
can damage your privacy, see our
<a href="cookies.html">page on cookies.</a>
For highly detailed technical information see the

The

<p>
Possibly.
Some personalized services including certain

will not automatically recognize you if you don't send them the cookie they
assigned you. And there are a very small number of sites that do
strange things with cookies; they don't work for anyone that blocks
cookies by any means.
Some sites such as
<a href="links.html#withhold">Microsoft</a>
explain that their content is so wonderfully compelling that
they will withhold it from you unless you submit to their
inserting cookies.
<p>
<a name="want">If you want such sites to be given your cookies,</a>
you can use the
<a href="ijbman.html#cookiefile">cookiefile</a>

yourself.
Simply include the domain name of those sites in the

<a name="one">It's possible to let cookies out but not in,</a>
which is enough to keep some sites happy, but not all of them:

A cookiefile containing

<p>
<a name="else">If someone else is running the</a>

you can try editing your browser's cookie

fill out and submit your subscription details

then
reconfigure your browser to use the

again
(and stop more cookies being sent).
This also requires the
<a href="ijbman.html#cookiefile">cookiefile</a>
option,
and its success depends on the Web site
not wanting to change your cookies at every session.
For this reason it does not work at some major newspaper sites, for example.

</h3>
<p>
<a name="discard">Yes, since version 1.2 the</a>
Internet Junkbuster

Unless you specify otherwise,
cookies are discarded (``crumbled'') by the
Internet Junkbuster
whether they came from the server or the browser.
In Version 1.2 and later you can

<h3><a name="wafers" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=wafers"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Can I make up my own fake cookies (wafers) to feed to servers?
</h3>
<p>
Yes,
using the
<a href="ijbman.html#wafer">wafer</a>
option.
We coined the term
<i><dfn>wafer</dfn></i>
to describe cookies chosen by a user,
not the Web server.
Servers may not find wafers as tasty as the cookies
they make themselves.
But users may enjoy controlling servers' diets for various reasons,
such as the following.
<br><ul  type="1">
<li>
<a name="retaliate">Users who consider cookies to</a>
be an unwelcome intrusion and a waste
of their disk space can respond in kind.
By writing ``signature wafers'' they can
express their feelings about cookies,
in a place that the people
in charge of them are most likely to notice.
<li>
<a name="notice">Sites running a proxy</a>
that logs cookies to a file
(such as the
Internet Junkbuster
does with the
<a href="ijbman.html#jarfile">jarfile</a>
option on)
may want to notify
servers that their cookies are being intercepted,
deleted or copied.
One possible reason for doing this is the uncertain copyright status
of cookie strings.
<a href="over.html#notlaw">Nothing</a>
here should be taken as legal advice: we are simply raising a question
for any interested parties to consider,
and make no representation that such measures are necessary or sufficient.
Concerned proxy sites might decide to send a wafer
(named ``NOTICE'' for example)
containing text along the lines of the following.
<blockquote>
<p>
<a name="licenses_on_cookies_refused">TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN</a>
<i>
<br>
<br>
Do not send me any copyrighted information other than the
document that I am requesting or any of its necessary components.
<br>
<br>
In particular do not send me any cookies that
are subject to a claim of copyright by anybody.
Take notice that I refuse to be bound by any license condition
(copyright or otherwise) applying to any cookie.
</i>
</blockquote>
Any company that tries to argue in court that the proxy site
was breaching their copyright in the cookies would
be met with the defense that the proxy site gave that company
the opportunity to protect its copyright by simply
not sending cookies after receiving the notice. 
<p>
<a name="pointer">Cookies can be as long as four thousand characters,</a>
so there's plenty of space for lawyerly verbosity,
but white space, commas, and semi-colons are
<a href="ijbman.html#o_w">prohibited.</a>
Spaces can be turned into underscores.
Alternatively,
a
<small>URL</small>
could be sent as the cookie value,
pointing to a document containing a notice,
perhaps with a suggestive value such as
<br>
<big><kbd>http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijbfaq.html#licenses_on_cookies_refused</kbd></big>
<br>
But including the notice directly would probably be preferable
because the addressee does not have to look it up.
<p>
<a name="vanilla">The</a>
Internet Junkbuster 2.0
currently sends a full notice as a
``vanilla wafer''
if cookies are being logged to a cookie jar
and no other wafers have been specified.
It can be suppressed with the
<a href="ijbman.html#suppress-vanilla-wafer">suppress-vanilla-wafer</a>
option,
which might be used in situations where there is an established understanding
between the proxy and all who serve it.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="gimme">Junkbusters provides a</a>
<small>CGI</small>
script that lets you
<a href="ijbfaq.html#headers">see</a>
your wafers as they appear to servers.
<p>

If this troubles you, don't use this option.
<p>
<a name="regardless">Any wafers specified are sent to</a>

The

<big><kbd>$</kbd></big>
character
(such as the
<big><kbd>Version</kbd></big>
attribute)
are transparent
to the proxy; it simply quotes what was recited by the browser.
<p>
<a name="personalize">If you want to send wafers only to specific sites,</a>
you could try putting them your browser's cookie file in a format
conforming to the Netscape

<a href="ijbfaq.html#directional">sent to</a>

This may work with Netscape but not all other browsers.

Why would anyone want to save their cookies in a ``cookie jar?''
</h3>
<p>
We provided this capability just in case anyone wants it.
There are a few possible reasons.
<br><ul  type="1">
<li>
<a name="pay">It's conceivable that</a>
marketing companies might one day
<a href="new.html#hagel">buy</a>
history files and cookie jars from consumers
in the same way that they currently pay them to fill out survey forms.
With this information they could
gather psychographic information,
see which competitors' sites the consumer has visited,
and discover what advertising is being targeted at them.
<li>
<a name="choose">Some consumers might</a>
employ semi-automated means of sorting through
their cookie jars, selecting which ones to place in their cookies
file for use by their browsers.
Their decisions could be based on payments offered,
privacy rating systems such as
<a href="links.html#truste">TRUSTe</a>
proposes,
or their own opinion of the company.
It could be done manually or with software.
<li>
<a name="share">Users may even start ``sharing'' cookies among themselves,</a>
sending back cookies that servers generated for other visitors.
Servers that aren't expecting this possibility
will be misled about their visitors' identities.
Cookies could be shared among users on a single machine,
or across continents via
<small>FTP</small>
and anonymous remailers.
<a name="disinformation">Privacy activists may promote</a>
cookie disinformation campaigns
as a way to defend the public against abuse.
If a significant percentage of people send disinformative cookies,
user tracking via cookies may become less reliable and less used.

<p>
<a name="happen">The</a>

<a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/cgi-bin/privacy">disclose the user's email address</a>

you might consider

<p>
<a name="binaries">Browsers downloaded as binaries</a>

Why should I trust my ISP or Junkbusters with my browsing data?
</h3>
<p>
You shouldn't have to trust us, and you certainly don't have to.
We do not run the proxy as a service,

If they run a proxy for you, using it could actually

</h3>
<p>
The

unless instructed otherwise in the options.
<br><ul  type="1">
<li>
<a name="from">The</a>
<big><kbd>FROM</kbd></big>

<li>

Misidentification helps resist certain
<a href="ijbfaq.html#misidentify">attacks.</a>
If your browser and hardware happen to be accurately identified,
you might want to change the default.
(Earlier versions of the

<li>
<a name="referer">The</a>

is dropped.
A single static referer to replace all

Possibly.  If used with a browser less advanced than Netscape 3.0 or IE-3,

How is misidentifying my browser good for security and privacy?
</h3>
<p>
Almost
<a href="new.html#Browser">every</a>
major release of both leading browsers has contained
bugs that allow malicious servers to compromise your privacy and security.
Known bugs are quickly fixed, but millions of copies of the affected
software remain out there, and yours is probably one of them.
The
<a href="ijbfaq.html#agent">header</a>
that normally identifies your browser tells such servers exactly which attacks
to use against you.
By misidentifying your browser you reduce the likelihood that they
will be able to mount a successful attack.
</p>

<h3><a name="conceal" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=conceal"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Does the Internet Junkbuster conceal my IP address?
</h3>
<p>
Web sites get the IP address of any proxy or browser they serve pages to.
If you run the proxy on your own computer the IP address disclosed
is the same as your browser would, unless you use the
<a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwardfile</a>
option is used to chain to another proxy,
in which case servers only get the last IP address in the chain.
Chaining slightly slows browsing of course, but it improves anonymity.
<p>
<a name="anonymizing">One public proxy that you can</a>
forward to is
<a href="new.html#LPWA">lpwa.com</a>
port 8000.
Read about its privacy-enhancing
features and the authentication procedures first,
and note that it blocks
<a href="ijbfaq.html#wired">referer</a>
in almost all cases,
as well as some
<a href="http://lpwa.com:8000/system.html#principles:header">other headers.</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="authorize" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=authorize"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
How can I set the proxy to remember my LPWA password?
</h3>
<p>
After you log in to
<a href="http://lpwa.com">LPWA</a>
it tells your browser to send a
<big><kbd>Proxy-authorization</kbd></big>
header with each request.
Whenever you shut down the browser and start again with a new browser,
you need to log in again.
If you are the only person using the
Internet Junkbuster
proxy, you can avoid repeated logins to
<a href="http://lpwa.com">LPWA</a>
by telling the
Internet Junkbuster
to send the information by placing a line such as
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>add-header Proxy-authorization: Basic ZHVtbXk=.</kbd></big>
<br>
in the configuration file.
The exact example above
<em>does not work</em>
because the code
<big><kbd>ZHVtbXk=.</kbd></big>
is a bogus one that
<a href="http://lpwa.com">LPWA</a>
would never generate;
follow the procedure below to generate a valid one.
<br><ol  type="1">
<li>
<a name="eight">Restart your</a>
Internet Junkbuster
with
<big><kbd>debug 8</kbd></big>
so you can see the
<a href="ijbman.html#o_d">headers.</a>
<li>
<a name="login">Log in to</a>
<a href="http://lpwa.com">LPWA</a>
and go to any other site.
<li>
<a name="observe">Find the</a>
<big><kbd>Proxy-authorization</kbd></big>
header from the debug output and paste it
after the word
<a href="ijbman.html#add-header">add-header</a>
into the config file.
Also change the debug value back again.
<li>
<a name="return">Shut down your browser, start it up again, and</a>
restart the proxy. Test that it works.
</ol>
This trick is convenient for sole users, but is not suitable when
more than one person uses the proxy, because they will all get the
same
<a href="http://lpwa.com">LPWA</a>
identity.
</p>

<h3><a name="ident" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=ident"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Does the Internet Junkbuster thwart identification by identd?
</h3>
<p>
We think so,
provided you are not the user running the
proxy.
If your computer (or your
<small>ISP</small>'s)
is running the
<a href="links.html#identd"><kbd>identd</kbd></a>
demon,
servers can ask it for the identity of the
user making the request at time you request a page from them.
But if you're going through a proxy,
they will identify the user name associated with the proxy, not you.
A visit to
<a href="http://ident.junkbusters.com">http://ident.junkbusters.com</a>
lets you see what's happening.
This test is (quite rightly) blocked by many
<a href="ijbfaq.html#firewall">firewalls;</a>
just interrupt the transfer if you get an abnormal wait after clicking.
Running other applications
may also expose you via
<a href="links.html#identd"><kbd>identd</kbd></a>;
the proxy of course doesn't help then.
</p>

<h3><a name="detect" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=detect"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Can web sites tell that I'm using the Internet Junkbuster?
</h3>
<p>
With the default options the proxy doesn't announce itself.
Obvious indications such as
<a href="links.html#alive">Keep-Alive</a>
headers are
<a href="ijbman.html#o_x">deleted,</a>
but sites might notice that you can cancel cookies faster than
any human could possibly click on a mouse.
(If you want to provide a
plausible explanation for this,
change the User Agent header to a
<a href="ijbfaq.html#lynx">cookie-free</a>
or
<a href="cookies.html#communicator">cookie-crunching</a>
browser).
<p>
<a name="figure">But when certain options</a>
are used they could figure out something's going on,
even if they're not pushing cookies.
If you use blocking
they can tell from their logs that the graphics in their pages
are not being requested selectively.
The
<a href="ijbman.html#add-forwarded-header">add-forwarded-header</a>
option explicitly announces to the server that a proxy is present,
and
sending them
<a href="ijbfaq.html#wafers">wafers</a>
is of course a dead giveaway.

What happens with Secure Documents (SSL, https:)?
</h3>
<p>
If you enter a
``Secure Document Area,''
cookies and other header information
such as User Agent and Referer
are sent encrypted,
so they cannot be filtered.
We recommend getting your browser to alert you when this happens.
(On Netscape:

We also recommend adding the line
<big><kbd>:443</kbd></big>
to the blockfile to stop all but sites specified in an exception
after that line from using SSL.

<a name="passage">It may be possible to filter encrypted cookies</a>

Will using this as my Security Proxy compromise security?
</h3>
<p>
We're not security experts, but we don't think so.
The whole point of
<small>SSL</small>
is that the
contents of messages are
<!-- IEM: http://addy.com/dc/html/what_is_ssl_.html -->
encrypted
by the time
they leave the browser and the server.
Eavesdroppers (including proxies) can see where your messages are going
whether you are running a proxy or not,
but they only get to see the contents after they have been encrypted.

<h3><a name="restrict" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=restrict"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Can I restrict use of the proxy to a set of nominated IP addresses?
</h3>
<p>
Yes, we added an
<a href="ijbman.html#aclfile">access control</a>
file in Version 2.0.
But before you use it please consider why you want to do it.
If the reason is security,
it probably means you need a firewall.
<p>
<a name="selective">The</a>
<a href="ijbman.html#listen-address">listen-address</a>
option provides a way of binding the proxy to a single IP address/port.
The right way to do this is to choose a port inside your firewall, and
deny access to it to those outside the firewall.
The
Internet Junkbuster
is not a firewall proxy;
it should not be expected to solve security problems.

<h3><a name="others" href="/cgi-bin/gp?pg=ijbfaq&pr=others"><img border=0 width=14 height=14 src="/images/fb.gif" alt="&lt;Feedback&gt"></a>&#160;
Are there any security risks for ISPs or others who offer the proxy?
</h3>
<p>
Yes.
As with any service offered over the Internet,
hackers can try to misuse it.
A well-run
<small>ISP</small>
will have professionals who are experienced at assessing and containing
these risks.
<p>
<a name="outside">It's possible to set up your machine so</a>
that other people can have access to your proxy,
but if you lack expertise in computer security
you probably shouldn't have your computer configured to offer
this or any other service to the outside world.
<p>
<a name="attack">Hackers can attempt to gain access</a>
to the machine by various attacks,
which we have tried to guard against but don't guarantee to thwart.
They can also use the ``anonymizing'' quality of proxies
to try to cover their tracks while hacking other computers.
For this reason we recommend preventing it being used
as an anonymous
<big><kbd>telnet</kbd></big>
by putting the pattern
<big><kbd>:23</kbd></big>
in the blockfile (it's included as standard equipment).
(Actually the current implementation incidentally blocks telnet due to the
way headers are handled, but it's best not to rely on this.)
If you wish to block all ports except the default
<small>HTTP</small>
port 80,
you can put the lines
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>:</kbd></big>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;<big><kbd>~:80</kbd></big>
<br>
at the beginning of the blockfile, but be aware that some servers
run on non-default ports (e.g. 8080). You might also want to add the line
<big><kbd>~:443</kbd></big>
to allow
<small>SSL</small>.
<p>
<a name="root">On</a>
<small>UNIX <a href="legal.html#not_our_trademark">&#174;</a></small>
systems it is neither necessary nor desirable for the proxy to run as root.
